// Use dynamic routing
// In this approach, you create a single template for the Pokémon detail page.
// The specific data for each Pokémon is then loaded dynamically based on the URL parameter.

// For example, if you're using a JavaScript framework like React, you might have a route like `/pokemon/:id`,
// where `:id` is a placeholder for the Pokémon ID. When a user navigates to `/pokemon/1`, your app would fetch the data for Pokémon with ID 1 and display it using the detail page template.
